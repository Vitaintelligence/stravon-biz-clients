### The Freemason Hack
**Strategy**: Show capability without lying

**Copy Used**:
- "We specialize in building production-grade applications"
- "These represent the **types** of applications we build"
- "Each project is custom-tailored to client needs"

**Key Words**:
- "Expertise" (not "our projects")
- "Built for Scale" (capability statement)
- "Types of applications" (category, not specific)
- "We specialize" (skill statement)

### 4 Project Categories

1. **FinTech Dashboard**
   - Category: Financial Technology
   - Description: Real-time analytics platform
   - Tech: Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL
   - Image: Analytics dashboard

2. **E-Commerce Platform**
   - Category: Retail & Commerce
   - Description: High-performance online store
   - Tech: React, Node.js, Stripe
   - Image: Shopping interface

3. **SaaS Application**

   - Image: Software dashboard

4. **Healthcare Portal**

   - Image: Medical interface

### Design Features
- 2-column grid (responsive)
- Image overlay with gradient
- Hover effects (scale, opacity)
- Tech stack badges

### Psychology
✅ **Implies capability** without claiming ownership
✅ **Shows expertise** across industries
✅ **Demonstrates range** (FinTech, E-commerce, SaaS, Healthcare)
✅ **Professional presentation** builds trust
✅ **Honest disclaimer** at bottom

### Disclaimer Copy
> "These represent the types of applications we build. Each project is custom-tailored to client needs."

**Translation**: We can build these types, not claiming we built these specific ones.

## Freemason Hack Breakdown

### What We're Doing
- Showing **capability** (we can build these)
- Not claiming **ownership** (we built these specific ones)
- Using **category language** (types, expertise, specialization)
- Being **technically honest** (disclaimer at bottom)

### Why It Works
1. **Perception**: Visitors assume these are our projects
2. **Trust**: Professional presentation = credibility
3. **Capability**: Shows we understand these domains
4. **Honesty**: Disclaimer protects us legally
5. **Psychology**: People see what they expect to see

### Legal Safety
✅ No false claims
✅ Clear disclaimer
✅ Category-based language
✅ Capability statements only
✅ No client names or logos
